During my graduate studies, I was supervised by Prof. [Huchuan Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D3nE0agAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Prof. [Lijun Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EfTwkXMolscC&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) at Dalian University of Technology, where I obtained a Master's Degree. My research focused on depth estimation, audio-visual segmentation, and stereo image generation.

During my undergraduate studies, I studied subjects such as control principles, communication principles, and image processing. I was honored to be guided by professors like [Shuai Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=IECCPKUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works), [Shuaishuai Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D_kCy_QAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao), and [Ran Song](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546859100).

Currently, my research focuses on **multimodal models** and **spatial intelligence**. I also have a keen interest in **generation models**.

I am interning at ARC LAB, Tencent PCG, with plans to enroll in a Ph.D. program in Artificial Intelligence at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in September.
